<h3>4. Data collection on our website</h3>
<h4>Cookies</h4>
<p>Some of our web pages use cookies. Cookies do not harm your computer and do not contain any viruses. Cookies help
    make our website more user-friendly, efficient, and secure. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your
    computer and saved by your browser.</p>
<p>Most of the cookies we use are so-called &#8220;session cookies.&#8221; They are automatically deleted after your
    visit. Other cookies remain in your device&#8217;s memory until you delete them. These cookies make it possible to
    recognize your browser when you next visit the site.</p>
<p>You can configure your browser to inform you about the use of cookies so that you can decide on a case-by-case basis
    whether to accept or reject a cookie. Alternatively, your browser can be configured to automatically accept cookies
    under certain conditions or to always reject them, or to automatically delete cookies when closing your browser.
    Disabling cookies may limit the functionality of this website.</p>
<p>Cookies which are necessary to allow electronic communications or to provide certain functions you wish to use (such
    as the shopping cart) are stored pursuant to Art. 6 paragraph 1, letter f of GDPR. The website operator has a
    legitimate interest in the storage of cookies to ensure an optimized service provided free of technical errors. If
    other cookies (such as those used to analyze your surfing behavior) are also stored, they will be treated separately
    in this privacy policy.</p>
<h4>Server log files</h4>
<p>The website provider automatically collects and stores information that your browser automatically transmits to us in
    &#8220;server log files&#8221;. These are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Browser type and browser version</li>
    <li>Operating system used</li>
    <li>Referrer URL</li>
    <li>Host name of the accessing computer</li>
    <li>Time of the server request</li>
    <li>IP address</li>
</ul>
<p>These data will not be combined with data from other sources.</p>
<p>The basis for data processing is Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR, which allows the processing of data to fulfill a contract or
    for measures preliminary to a contract.</p>
<h4>Contact form</h4>
<p>Should you send us questions via the contact form, we will collect the data entered on the form, including the
    contact details you provide, to answer your question and any follow-up questions. We do not share this information
    without your permission.</p>
<p>We will, therefore, process any data you enter onto the contact form only with your consent per Art. 6 (1)(a) GDPR.
    You may revoke your consent at any time. An informal email making this request is sufficient. The data processed
    before we receive your request may still be legally processed.</p>
<p>We will retain the data you provide on the contact form until you request its deletion, revoke your consent for its
    storage, or the purpose for its storage no longer pertains (e.g. after fulfilling your request). Any mandatory
    statutory provisions, especially those regarding mandatory data retention periods, remain unaffected by this
    provision.</p>
<h3>5. Social Share</h3>
<p>We at the World Future Council aim to improve your user experience whilst ensuring the highest possible level of data
    security. We encourage our users to share our content on their Social Media profiles such as Facebook, Twitter or
    Instagram.</p>
<p>Until recently however, these social share options connected to your profile unbeknownst to you and collected data
    regarding your surfing behaviour, even if you did not click on “share”.</p>
<p>The Shariff Plugin allows you to share your favourite web content without compromising your privacy. The Shariff
    button establishes direct contact between the social network and the user only when you actively click the ‘Share’
    button. Only then will your data be transferred to the respective social network. If, however, the Shariff button is
    not clicked, no exchange will be made between you and the social network.</p>
<h3>6. Analytics and advertising</h3>
<h4>Google Analytics</h4>
<p>This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service. It is operated by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre
    Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.</p>
<p>Google Analytics uses so-called &#8220;cookies&#8221;. These are text files that are stored on your computer and that
    allow an analysis of the use of the website by you. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this
    website is usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there.</p>
<p>Google Analytics cookies are stored based on Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in
    analyzing user behavior to optimize both its website and its advertising.</p>
<p><strong>IP anonymization</strong></p>
<p>We have activated the IP anonymization feature on this website. Your IP address will be shortened by Google within
    the European Union or other parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area prior to transmission to the
    United States. Only in exceptional cases is the full IP address sent to a Google server in the US and shortened
    there. Google will use this information on behalf of the operator of this website to evaluate your use of the
    website, to compile reports on website activity, and to provide other services regarding website activity and
    Internet usage for the website operator. The IP address transmitted by your browser as part of Google Analytics will
    not be merged with any other data held by Google.</p>
<p><strong>Browser plugin</strong></p>
<p>You can prevent these cookies being stored by selecting the appropriate settings in your browser. However, we wish to
    point out that doing so may mean you will not be able to enjoy the full functionality of this website.
</p>
<p><strong>Objecting to the collection of data</strong></p>
<p>You can prevent the collection of your data by Google Analytics by clicking on the following link. An opt-out cookie
    will be set to prevent your data from being collected on future visits to this site: <a class="deactivate-google"
                                                                                            href="#">Disable Google
        Analytics</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Outsourced data processing</strong></p>
<p>We have entered into an agreement with Google for the outsourcing of our data processing and fully implement the
    strict requirements of the German data protection authorities when using Google Analytics.</p>
<h4>Google AdWords and Google Conversion Tracking</h4>
<p>This website uses Google AdWords. AdWords is an online advertising program from Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater
    Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States (&#8220;Google&#8221;).</p>
<p>As part of Google AdWords, we use so-called conversion tracking. When you click on an ad served by Google, a
    conversion tracking cookie is set. Cookies are small text files that your internet browser stores on your computer.
    These cookies expire after 30 days and are not used for personal identification of the user. Should the user visit
    certain pages of the website and the cookie has not yet expired, Google and the website can tell that the user
    clicked on the ad and proceeded to that page.</p>
<p>Each Google AdWords advertiser has a different cookie. Thus, cookies cannot be tracked using the website of an
    AdWords advertiser. The information obtained using the conversion cookie is used to create conversion statistics for
    the AdWords advertisers who have opted for conversion tracking. Customers are told the total number of users who
    clicked on their ad and were redirected to a conversion tracking tag page. However, advertisers do not obtain any
    information that can be used to personally identify users. If you do not want to participate in tracking, you can
    opt-out of this by easily disabling the Google Conversion Tracking cookie by changing your browser settings. In
    doing so, you will not be included in the conversion tracking statistics.</p>
<p>Conversion cookies are stored based on Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in
    analyzing user behavior to optimize both its website and its advertising.</p>
<p>You can configure your browser to inform you about the use of cookies so that you can decide on a case-by-case basis
    whether to accept or reject a cookie. Alternatively, your browser can be configured to automatically accept cookies
    under certain conditions or to always reject them, or to automatically delete cookies when closing your browser.
    Disabling cookies may limit the functionality of this website.</p>
<h4><b>Google Tag Manager</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This website uses Google Tag Manager. Google Tag Manager is a solution operated by Google LLC. 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (“Google”) that allows marketed website tags to be managed using an interface. The Tag Manager tool itself (which implements the tags) is a cookie-less domain and does not register personal data. The tool causes other tags to be activated which may, for their part, register data under certain circumstances. Google Tag Manager does not access this information. If recording has been deactivated on domain or cookie level, this setting will remain in place for all tracking tags implemented with Google Tag Manager.</span>
</p>
<h4>Google reCAPTCHA</h4>
<p>We use &#8220;Google reCAPTCHA&#8221; (hereinafter &#8220;reCAPTCHA&#8221;) on our websites. This service is provided
    by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (&#8220;Google&#8221;).</p>
<p>reCAPTCHA is used to check whether the data entered on our website (such as on a contact form) has been entered by a
    human or by an automated program. To do this, reCAPTCHA analyzes the behavior of the website visitor based on
    various characteristics. This analysis starts automatically as soon as the website visitor enters the website. For
    the analysis, reCAPTCHA evaluates various information (e.g. IP address, how long the visitor has been on the
    website, or mouse movements made by the user). The data collected during the analysis will be forwarded to
    Google.</p>
<p>The reCAPTCHA analyses take place completely in the background. Website visitors are not advised that such an
    analysis is taking place.</p>
<p>Data processing is based on Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in protecting its
    site from abusive automated crawling and spam.</p>
<h3>7. Newsletter</h3>
<h4>Newsletter data</h4>
<p>If you would like to receive our newsletter, we require a valid email address as well as information that allows us
    to verify that you are the owner of the specified email address and that you agree to receive this newsletter. No
    additional data is collected or is only collected on a voluntary basis. We only use this data to send the requested
    information and do not pass it on to third parties.</p>
<p>We will, therefore, process any data you enter onto the contact form only with your consent per Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR.
    You can revoke consent to the storage of your data and email address as well as their use for sending the newsletter
    at any time, e.g. through the &#8220;unsubscribe&#8221; link in the newsletter. The data processed before we receive
    your request may still be legally processed.</p>
<p>The data provided when registering for the newsletter will be used to distribute the newsletter until you cancel your
    subscription when said data will be deleted. Data we have stored for other purposes (e.g. email addresses for the
    members area) remain unaffected.</p>
<h4>MailChimp</h4>
<p>This website uses the services of MailChimp to send newsletters. This service is provided by Rocket Science Group
    LLC, 675 Ponce De Leon Ave NE, Suite 5000, Atlanta, GA 30308, USA.</p>
<p>MailChimp is a service which organizes and analyzes the distribution of newsletters. If you provide data (e.g. your
    email address) to subscribe to our newsletter, it will be stored on MailChimp servers in the USA.</p>
<p>MailChimp is certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield. The Privacy Shield is an agreement between the European Union
    (EU) and the US to ensure compliance with European privacy standards in the United States.</p>
<p>We use MailChimp to analyze our newsletter campaigns. When you open an email sent by MailChimp, a file included in
    the email (called a web beacon) connects to MailChimp&#8217;s servers in the United States. This allows us to
    determine if a newsletter message has been opened and which links you click on. In addition, technical information
    is collected (e.g. time of retrieval, IP address, browser type, and operating system). This information cannot be
    assigned to a specific recipient. It is used exclusively for the statistical analysis of our newsletter campaigns.
    The results of these analyses can be used to better tailor future newsletters to your interests.</p>
<p>If you do not want your usage of the newsletter to be analyzed by MailChimp, you will have to unsubscribe from the
    newsletter. For this purpose, we provide a link in every newsletter we send. You can also unsubscribe from the
    newsletter directly on the website.</p>
<p>Data processing is based on Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR. You may revoke your consent at any time by unsubscribing to the
    newsletter. The data processed before we receive your request may still be legally processed.</p>
<p>The data provided when registering for the newsletter will be used to distribute the newsletter until you cancel your
    subscription when said data will be deleted from our servers and those of MailChimp. Data we have stored for other
    purposes (e.g. email addresses for the members area) remains unaffected.</p>
<p><strong>Completion of a data processing agreement</strong></p>
<p>We have entered into a data processing agreement with MailChimp, in which we require MailChimp to protect the data of
    our customers and not to disclose said data to third parties. This agreement may be viewed at the following link: <a
            href="https://mailchimp.com/legal/forms/data-processing-agreement/sample-agreement/">https://mailchimp.com/legal/forms/data-processing-agreement/sample-agreement/</a>.
